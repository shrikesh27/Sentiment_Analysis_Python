# Sentiment Analysis with Python

## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based sentiment analysis project, adapted from a YouTube tutorial hosted on Kaggle. It analyzes text data to determine sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This project serves as an educational resource for learning sentiment analysis.

## Features

- Preprocesses text data for analysis.
- Uses NLP libraries like NLTK and TextBlob for sentiment scoring.
- Visualizes sentiment results with charts or graphs.
- Includes step-by-step explanations suitable for beginners.

## Repository Structure

- `sentiment-analysis-python.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with the sentiment analysis code.
- `Reviews.csv`: Placeholder for the text dataset (replace with your own or download from Kaggle).
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- `LICENSE`: MIT License for the project.
- `.gitignore`: Excludes unnecessary files from version control.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sentiment_Analysis_Python.git
   cd Sentiment_Analysis_Python
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install Jupyter (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `sentiment-analysis-python.ipynb` and run the cells to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Perform sentiment analysis.
   - Visualize results.

3. Replace `dataset.csv` with your own text dataset or download the original dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/robikscube/sentiment-analysis-python-youtube-tutorial/data). Ensure the dataset has a column for text content.

## Dataset

The included `dataset.csv` is a placeholder. The original dataset (e.g., tweets or reviews) is available on Kaggle. To use your own dataset:
- Format it as a CSV with at least one column containing text (e.g., `text`).
- Update the notebook’s data loading cell to match your dataset’s column names.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m "Add feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-name`).
5. Open a pull request.
